# Project Overview

This project involves the development of an interactive Excel dashboard to evaluate first-quarter healthcare facility performance. The dashboard provides a consolidated view of patient visits, service outcomes, waiting times, and departmental performance, enabling quick and informed operational decision-making.

#### Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Excel

Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

Excel Formulas

Slicers and Filters

#### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes first-quarter healthcare facility records such as:

Patient visit counts

Visit status (completed, admitted, pending)

Departmental outcomes

Diagnosis categories

Payment types

Waiting time metrics

#### Dashboard Design

The dashboard is designed with interactive slicers that allow users to filter results by:

Health facility

Visit status

Month

This enables dynamic exploration of performance trends and comparisons across facilities and departments.

### Key Metrics & Visuals
